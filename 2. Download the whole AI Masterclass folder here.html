<p>Hi guys,</p><p>you did it! Now it is time for you to have the whole AI Masterclass folder containing the entire implementation of the Full World Model trained for Car Racing. You will find everything in the zip folder at the bottom below.</p><p>Before we do the final race we have to install all the packages required to run the Full World Model in the CarRacingGame environment. I will explain everything in detail from start to finish in the next tutorial, but please copy paste somewhere before the following line commands which we will enter together one by one in a terminal:</p><ol><li><p>conda create -n masterai python=3.6</p></li><li><p>conda activate masterai</p></li><li><p>conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow</p></li><li><p>python -m pip install cma</p></li><li><p>conda install -c anaconda mpi4py</p></li><li><p>conda install -c kne pybox2d</p></li><li><p>pip install pillow</p></li><li><p>pip install gym==0.9.4</p></li></ol><p>And once everything is installed, you will be ready for the final AI vs. HI competition!</p>
